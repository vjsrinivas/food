### Blueberry Cheese Cake
**Summary:** Made a cheese cake with a "basque" burnt top. The inside was stuff with blueberries, and I made a quick and dirty blueberry-based syrup. This is one of my favorite dishes from both a cooking and eating experience. Although, I wished I whisked harder and longer so the cream cheese portion was smoother.

### Samosa
**Summary:** Made an awesome Indian snack. Deep-fried with potatoe and pea filling, and the dough itself was made from scratch. One of my favorite Indian dishes and something I love sharing with my friends.

### Puff Pastry Pie
**Summary:** A mistake at first. I wanted to make a traditional puff pastry, but it did not properly rise. I just readapted to be a pie crust and added some strawberry filling. It was very flaky, dense, and sweet - even without the strawberry filling. Definitely one of the most unhealthy deserts I've ever made.

### Sourbread
**Summary:** Not the best looking picture, but a very simple sourbread dough when everything was closing up in 2020. Tried making my own yeast, did not go according to plan. Very hard on the outside, soft on the inside, but very flat with little to no rise. It tasted very nice though.

### Cornflake Cake
**Summary:** A promising recipe I found on Instagram, but when I finished it, I realized that the cornflake base was harder than a rock. Still very good and very chocolately.

### Blueberry Pound Cake
**Summary:** My first attempt at a poundcake. Infused the batter with blueberry and raspberry. The cake turned out mediocre but was very edible.

### Mushroom Sandwich
**Summary:** I watched an Instagram post where a person made fake "meat" with oven-roasted mushrooms. I attempted to replicate with some normal white mushrooms, and I assembled a simple sandwich with it. The sandwich was pretty good - maybe a little too salty.

### "From Scratch" Taco
**Summary:** I wanted to make a corn-based tortilla from scratch, and it was surprisingly simple and easy enough. The hard part was making the rest of the taco. Overall, it was a great tasting and cooking experience, and I would love to make tortillas from scratch again!

### Puff Pastry
**Summary:** This is just a simple, handmade puff pastry dough with a simple syrup with fruit on top of it. Very tasty, but it took a lot of effort to make puffy pastry dough from scratch.
